##React Part
## Tools & Technologies Used
-React.js - Used to create the main interactive component. React makes it easy to manage UI state using hooks like `useState`.
-CodeSandbox -An online IDE to write, run, and test the React app without local setup. Helped streamline collaboration and testing.                             
-JavaScript (ES6+) Modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, destructuring, and `useState` hooks simplified logic and state management.             
-TML & CSS HTML `index.html` served as the entry point. Basic inline CSS used for simple layout and button styling inside React components.
